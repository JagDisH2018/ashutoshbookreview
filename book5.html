	 <p>If you want to leave your footprints in the sands of time, do not drag your feet." These are one of the most enduring lines that still lay etched in my memory. I have read this book long back, and I don't remember when, but surely the essence remains with me even today. This book is best suited for reading for the teenagers, to dream and to dare. It shows, how a person from the modest background ends up in being the First Citizen of a nation of one billion. It shows how a scientist, devoid of basic tools, helps in culmination of a program which other love to loathe and deride. It shows a man, who lived his life in terms of his principles and nothing else. It shows how a common man, like you and me, can achieve when he can dream. And finally, it teaches how to dream --Tarun Mitra on Apr 26, 2012

<br>This is the most inspiring book I have ever read. Great salute to the man for his contribution to Indian Rocketry.I would like to recall few lines from book. 1. What you imagine, is what you transpire.What you believe is what you achieve. 2. A good plan executed violently right now is far better than a perfect plan executed next week. 3. Once your mind stretches to a new level it never goes back to its original dimension. 4. Adversities always presents opportunities for introspection. and the most inspiring line is.. "We all are born with divine fire in us.Our efforts should be to give wings --Devendra on Aug 26, 2012

After reading this book i realized the value of APJ abdul Kalam's dedication. Don't think about money to purchase this book to read a autobiography a spokesman,a president,a DRDO chief scientist,a ISRO chief scientist, a Bramohse supersonic missile innovator... --Naveen A H on Sep 5, 2011</p>
