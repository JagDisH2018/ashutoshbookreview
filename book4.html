Well, i had heard good things about this book and that is when i finally decided to buy it It started a bit slow and i was always trying to mentally compare it to "5 point someone" so i was initially a little disappointed but Boy, did i know what was coming up next, as chapters passed i got so much into the storyline that i did not even have track of time and read the book through the night to finish it The key points that i liked is 1. Simple and lively language 2. A potent mixture of humor and satire made on the cultures and the practices being followed in each state --Shridhar Shivaramakrishnan Mar 2, 2012

I am a real diehard fan of ChetanBhagat. He is my favorite writer. His books are my favorite.. "2states" the most favorite of them all.. 2States is one of the best love stories I have ever heard or read about. A real transpiring love story.. I read the book in one nonstop sitting. Completed reading it for the eighth time now and I've never got bored reading it.. The book is an eye opener for young minds.For someone who thought the journey from start of 'true love' towards tying the knot was easy,the first three quarters of the book will frighten you.It depends on the way you se --Vivek Joshy Jan 29, 2012
